# Ethernet Access Driver for BeagleBone Black

## Overview

This project provides a basic Ethernet access driver for the BeagleBone Black. The driver is implemented as a Linux kernel module and allows interaction with the Ethernet hardware on the BeagleBone Black, enabling network communication.

## Features

- Provides basic Ethernet access for the BeagleBone Black.
- Allows for network communication through the Ethernet interface.
- Demonstrates basic kernel module development for Ethernet communication.

## Requirements

- BeagleBone Black with a running Linux distribution.
- Linux kernel headers installed (ensure they match your running kernel).
- Basic understanding of C programming and Linux kernel module development.

## Directory Structure

```
ethernet_driver/
├── ethernet_driver.c  # The main source code file for the Ethernet access driver.
├── Makefile            # The Makefile to build the kernel module.
└── README.md           # This README file.
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Building the Driver

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ethernet_driver
   ```

2. **Compile the driver**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate the `ethernet_driver.ko` kernel module.

### Step 2: Loading the Driver

1. **Insert the kernel module**:
   ```bash
   sudo insmod ethernet_driver.ko
   ```

2. **Verify that the module has been loaded**:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep ethernet_driver
   ```

3. **Check the kernel log** for messages related to the driver:
   ```bash
   dmesg | tail
   ```

### Step 3: Configuring and Using the Driver

- After loading the module, configure the Ethernet interface as needed using standard Linux networking commands (e.g., `ifconfig` or `ip`).
- Modify the `ethernet_driver.c` file if you need to adjust driver parameters or implement additional functionality.

### Step 4: Unloading the Driver

1. **Remove the kernel module**:
   ```bash
   sudo rmmod ethernet_driver
   ```

2. **Clean up the build files**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
