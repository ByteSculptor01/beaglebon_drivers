# Simple UART Driver for BeagleBone Black

## Overview

This project provides a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) driver for the BeagleBone Black. The driver is implemented as a Linux kernel module and allows basic serial communication with the UART peripheral on the BeagleBone Black.

## Features

- Basic initialization of the UART peripheral.
- Send and receive data via the UART interface.
- Simple character device driver interface.
- Demonstrates kernel module development for UART communication.

## Requirements

- BeagleBone Black with a running Linux distribution.
- Linux kernel headers installed (ensure they match your running kernel).
- Basic understanding of C programming and Linux kernel module development.

## Directory Structure

```
uart_driver/
├── uart_driver.c   # The main source code file for the UART driver.
├── Makefile        # The Makefile to build the kernel module.
└── README.md       # This README file.
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Building the Driver

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/uart_driver
   ```

2. **Compile the driver**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate the `uart_driver.ko` kernel module.

### Step 2: Loading the Driver

1. **Insert the kernel module**:
   ```bash
   sudo insmod uart_driver.ko
   ```

2. **Verify that the module has been loaded**:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep uart_driver
   ```

3. **Check the kernel log** for messages related to the driver:
   ```bash
   dmesg | tail
   ```

### Step 3: Creating the Device Node

1. **Create a device node** to interact with the UART driver:
   ```bash
   sudo mknod /dev/uart_device c $(grep uart_device /proc/devices | awk '{print $1}') 0
   ```

### Step 4: Interacting with the Driver

1. **Write data** to the UART device:
   ```bash
   echo -n "A" > /dev/uart_device
   ```

2. **Read data** from the UART device:
   ```bash
   cat /dev/uart_device
   ```

### Step 5: Unloading the Driver

1. **Remove the kernel module**:
   ```bash
   sudo rmmod uart_driver
   ```

2. **Clean up the build files**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
